While rivers have relatively clear cut boundaries, flooded zones in the center of the image are more complex, with many dfferent land cover types mixed together in a close setting. When looking at the image on the left, some considerations for setting up an annotation would be:\n",

    "    - we can lump classes in with the background class if they are 1) rare and 2) they are not of interest. However, if we find with our models that a class of interest is confused with a rare class that we don't care about, it might be worth annotating this class in order to more holistically test our model's performance\n",
    "    - if we are primarily interested in mapping flooded forest, we might prioritize mapping flooded forest zones as a whole (ignoring microscale differences in cover, such as areas with slightly more canopy). It may also be a good idea to annotate rivers since this class could be easily confused with flooded areas.\n",
    "* how specific should these classes be? \n",
    "    - there's always an ideal set of classes we wish we could map and then there is what is possible with the data available\n",
    "    - some classes we wish to separate may be too spectrally similar with the data available to us\n",
    "    - a good example of this in the image above might be two different species of mangroves. With Landsat, Sentinel-2, or Planet imagery, we would not be able to map species level differences in naturally occurring mangrove trees.\n",
    "* phrased another way, is there a spectral or textural signal in the satellite imagery that annotators can see when annotating?\n",
    "    - if there's no signal, we either need to procure a better imagery source or refine the classes to make them more general to accomodate data limitations\n",
    "    - if there is a textural signal used in the modeling approach, the groundtruth data needs to be created as polygons, not points. Point-based reference data does not capture textural information and can only be used to train general-purpose machine learning algorithms like Random Forest or densely connected neural networks. CNNs require groundtruth data to be annotated as polygons.\n",
    "*  what is the timestamp of the image? all labels need to have the correct timestamp metadata that corresponds to the imag eused for annotation.\n",
    "    * this helps us consider what time periods the ML model was trained on and also when these labels are relevant. if the modeling approach needs to incorporate time series data, the labels must have timestamps to develop the model.\n"

Some deep learning models, such as Mask R-CNN, train a model end-to-end to take raster inputs and return instance segmentation outputs (which can be thought of as vectors or polygon coordinates).
